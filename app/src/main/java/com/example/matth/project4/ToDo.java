    V * ● Display a compass pointing north.
    V * ● Display:
    V * o The amount of steps taken by the user since the listener was registered.
    V * o The number of steps per second.
    V * o A button to reset the step counting and history.
    V * ● When it detects a shake, apply a random rotation animation to the compass.
    V * o The compass should always point north after the animation finishes.
    V * o Check “android.view.animation” for help.
    V * ● Create a Service that will be in charge of registering the user’s walking information:
    V * o Record the step history into a database.
     * o Notify the user when the service is started, bound, unbound, and stopped.
     V * ● Require the user to log in before using the app using a “user + password” combination. Store the
     V * information about the registered users in the database,
     *including their step history.
    V * ● Check first if the sensors exist and notify the user when they do not.
    V * ● Make the app as user friendly as possible.
    V * ● Handle all the possible exceptions. Don’t let your app crash.
